## Python
* creating-rasterframes [Error with overwrite, do we really need singlebandgeotiff?] - Follow up with Sim
* exporting-rasterframes [Savemode not defined, add examples with numpy] - Follow up with Sim
* getting-started [X]
* classification [X]
* clustering [X]
* statistics [X]
* ndvi [X]
* masking [Change color map to do a better job of accentuating features against the very negative NaN value]
* tile-arithmetic [X]
* local-spatial-functions [X]
* agg-functions [X]

NDVI demo:

Darden Towe:
Need agg functions
Need mask
Turn into array and compute stats (Euclidean distance to final pixel value maybe?)
Track growth of project over several years
Fix python to get rid of maps

Finish python case study 
Finish scala case studies
NBSPhinx and creating the docker container
Clear case studies w/ data scientists
Refine prose
