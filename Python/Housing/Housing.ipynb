    "Rasterframes is a powerful tool for combining geospatial data and spark dataframes. In this case study, we will explore the rate of development of a housing complex just outside of Charlottesville, Virginia, using aerial imagery captured over the course of four years. This tutorial assumes a basic knowledge of dataframes; more info can be found [here](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-programming-guide.html#datasets-and-dataframes):\n",

    "![-](pics/cascadia.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "[Cascadia](http://southern-development.com/communities/cascadia/) is a housing development built to the northeast of Charlottesville. The land was rezoned in 2007, but we are going to analyze how long it took to clear away the forest previously there. This data is available through NAIP (the National Agriculture Imagery Program) and consists of three images taken over the course of 4 years. The pictures have red, green, blue, and near-infrared bands and were taken during the summer of 2012, 2014, and 2016. This is aerial imagery, and has a high spatial resolution, which allows us a more precise measurement of the progression of the development. "

For instance, `localAggSum` will return a tile of the same size of the input tiles with the sum of all the cells as the output cells, much in the same way that local arithmetic functions operate (although local aggregated functions can operate on more than two tiles at once). The diagram below represents the process of performing `localAdd` on two tiles where the cells are colored (`localAggSum` is identical, but it operates on any number of tiles). There are other local aggregate functions, such as `localAggMin`, `localAggMax`, `localAggDataCells`, etc. A full list can be found in [the docs](Link goes here). \n",
