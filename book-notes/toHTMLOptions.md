Bookbook
* High number of stars
* Recommended in the lecture
* Simple
* Is already working for me

JupyterSite
* Also high number of stars
* Appears to be very similar to bookbook
* Also simple
* Writes the html straight to GitHub

[Sphynx] (http://nbsphinx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* More options
* More dependencies
* Does what we want, and then some
* Has feature to automatically hide cells in the html

Nbbook
* Very little attention
* Newer
* Doesn’t generate all books as html (only makes table of contents)
* Not what we want (I don’t think)

Nbconvert
* Totally built in to Jupiter
* The simplest option
* Generates books one at a time
